Welcome to my Tier List app!
I created this app to get some C# experience while using what I know with react js. It was fun working with the drag and drop feature.

To use this app:

1. Download
2. Open with vsCode (or your favorite editor)
3. Type "dotnet run" in the terminal
4. A webpage should automatically open up
5. Click on "Rank movies" or "Rank albums"
6. _Tip_ When dragging the images, wait for the cursor to show the plus sign before releasing to save the image's position.

I coded and followed along with this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RKuyp_bOhY&t=644s
